# Mu

Apply The Elm Architecture pattern on Xamarin stack, with another simple, unobtrusive way.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cxa/Mu.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cxa/Mu)

## The Elm Architecture (TEA)

[TEA](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/) is all about Model, Update, and View, in **Mu**, it's specific to:

- Model â€” the state of a GUI component
- Update â€” a way to update your state
- View â€” a way to view your state as `UIView(Controller)`, `NSView(Controller)`, `Activity` and other platform view stacks that Xamarin supported

This is a simple pattern for architecting GUI components.

```fsharp
// Model
type Model = { ... }

// Actions, all update through action to perform
type Action = Reset | ...

// Update
let update model action =
  match action with
  | Reset -> Update { model with ... }
  ...

// View
type ViewController (handle:IntPtr) =
  inherit UIViewController (handle)
  ...

  override x.ViewDidLoad () =
    base.ViewDidLoad ()
    // Glue model update view
    Mu.run initModel update x

  interface Mu.IView<Model, Action> with
    // Setup view and model relationship
    member x.BindModel model =
      <@
        x.someLabel.Text <- model.Field
        ...
      @>

    // Setup communicating between view and model, via aciton
    member x.BindAction send =
      x.resetButton.TouchUpInside.Add (fun _ -> send Reset)
      ...
```

That is really the essence of The Elm Architecture!

With **Mu**, Model and Update are separated from view, this means that they can shared across platforms, implementing `Mu.IView<'model, 'acition>` interfaces is the only required step to support specific platform.

### Model

Model should be a DTO(Data Transfer Object) only, immutable record is the best way to represent model in F#.

### Update

```fsharp
type Update<'model, 'action> =
  | NoUpdate
  | Update of 'model
  | UpdateWithEffects of 'model * Effects<'model, 'action>
  | Effects of Effects<'model, 'action>
and Effects<'model, 'action> =
  | Eff of ('model -> unit)
  | Cmd of ('model -> 'action)
  | AsyncCmd of ('model -> Async<'action>)
  | AsyncCmd' of ('model -> Async<'action> * CancellationTokenSource)
```

Update is about changing model through action: `'model -> 'action -> Update<'model, 'action>`.

Not all updates are just model changes, side effects without or with model changing are common. **Mu** provides current model state and the action sender when performing side effects.

### View

```fsharp
type IView<'model, 'action> =
  abstract BindModel: 'model -> Expr<unit>
  abstract BindAction: Action<'action> -> unit
```

View is only an interface in **Mu**, this is the most unobtrusive way to introduce 3rd lib into your project. Setup binding in `BindModel` to sync model states to view elements, and `BindAction` provides an action sender to make user input possible.

### Run

A **Mu** component is simply a record contained model initialization, model updater and view:

```fsharp
type T<'model, 'action> =
    { Init: unit -> 'model
      Update: 'model -> 'action -> Update<'model, 'action>
      View: IView<'model, 'action> }
```

Run component on view when it's ready with:

```fsharp
Mu.run' component
// or
Mu.run init update view
```
